    "The World Happiness Report, created by the UN every year, reports the perceived happiness of the people in different countries using a life evaluation survey. In order to predict which countries are the happiest, the report uses several factors including: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and corruption. Looking at all of these different factors that together form a predictor of life evaluation scores within a given country, it’s been found that government spending on aspects such as allocation to welfare heavily influence scores on life satisfaction (WHR 2020). The reason for this could be that citizens trust and depend on their government more in these countries to financially support them in times of strife or otherwise unexpected circumstances. This could be the case for the Nordic countries that consistently rank high within the World Happiness Report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there has been speculation that when citizens in the United States feel they can see tangible progress for the public that is directly funded by their tax dollar, they are likely to report higher life satisfaction as well as satisfaction with their respective government (Jacobs 2018). Perhaps this can be generalized to other countries as well, and so it depends on the governments’ decisions in terms of what sectors and projects they go on to utilize citizens’ money for.\n"

    "We hypothesize that the countries ranked in the top 3 of the World Happiness Report in 2020 (Finland, Denmark, Switzerland) have similar spending patterns in 2020 compared to the US. Specifically, we hypothesize that the “happier” countries have spent significantly greater amounts on healthcare, education, and social security compared to the US. We also hypothesize that the happier countries have spent significantly less on military and public safety compared to the US."

    "Our ideal dataset to help answer our question would be data on the government spending for each country broken down into healthcare, education and social security during 2020 for the top three countries in the Happiness report: Finland, Denmark, and Switzerland, in addition to the United States. The ideal number of observations will be 4 and this data will be collected from the government websites. We will also be using data on the quality of life based on the World Happiness Report which includes data on life evaluation, log GDP per capita, social support, health life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption for each country."

    "The data we need does not overstep any privacy or ethical requirements for this project is generally available to the public since most countries need to publicize what they’re allocating money towards. Since we’re using data that is collected by government officials, it is reputable since they are the ones generating this data to begin with. Our one concern is that the public data is most likely skewed in some way to depict a country’s benevolence. To assure that our data can be replicable, we will document each step of our research process that we got our findings from. Our research also shouldn’t be expected to produce potential harm because we are specifically choosing to use data that is only available to the public through government sources that anyone can access. Although we are trying to see the impact of government spending on quality of life, there are also other nuanced factors that may affect a country’s quality of life that we don’t consider in our research, like education and data that concerns inequalities between different demographics. Although these are our concerns, we believe that our research will still be fully conducted within the ethical data science guidelines to generate accurate and unbiased results.\n"
